3.1.1 Beginning Comments
All source files should begin with a c-style comment that lists the programmer(s), the date, a
copyright notice, and also a brief description of the purpose of the program. For example:
/*
 * Classname
*
 * Version info
 *
 * Copyright notice
 */
3.1.2 Package and Import Statements
The first non-comment line of most Java source files is a package statement. After that,
import statements can follow. For example:
package java.awt;
import java.awt.peer.CanvasPeer;



4 - Indentation
Four spaces should be used as the unit of indentation. The exact construction of the indentation
(spaces vs. tabs) is unspecified. Tabs must be set exactly every 8 spaces (not 4).


 4.1 Line Length
Avoid lines longer than 80 characters, since they’re not handled well by many terminals and
tools.
Note: Examples for use in documentation should have a shorter line length—generally no
more than 70 characters.


Wrapping Lines
When an expression will not fit on a single line, break it according to these general principles:
• Break after a comma.
• Break before an operator.
• Prefer higher-level breaks to lower-level breaks.
• Align the new line with the beginning of the expression at the same level on the previous
line.
• If the above rules lead to confusing code or to code that’s squished up against the right
margin, just indent 8 spaces instead.
Here are some examples of breaking method calls:
function(longExpression1, longExpression2, longExpression3,
 longExpression4, longExpression5);
var = function1(longExpression1,
 function2(longExpression2,
 longExpression3));
7 Methods These methods should be grouped by functionality rather than by scope or accessibility. For
example, a private class method can be in
between two public instance methods. The goal is
to make reading and understanding the code easier.

Following are two examples of breaking an arithmetic expression. The first is preferred, since
the break occurs outside the parenthesized expression, which is at a higher level.
longName1 = longName2 * (longName3 + longName4 - longName5)
 + 4 * longname6; // PREFER
longName1 = longName2 * (longName3 + longName4
 - longName5) + 4 * longname6; // AVOID
Following are two examples of indenting method declarations. The first is the conventional
case. The second would shift the second and third lines to the far right if it used conventional
indentation, so instead it indents only 8 spaces.
//CONVENTIONAL INDENTATION
someMethod(int anArg, Object anotherArg, String yetAnotherArg,
 Object andStillAnother) {
 ...
}
//INDENT 8 SPACES TO AVOID VERY DEEP INDENTS
private static synchronized horkingLongMethodName(int anArg,
 Object anotherArg, String yetAnotherArg,
 Object andStillAnother) {
 ...
}
Line wrapping for if statements should generally use the 8-space rule, since conventional (4
space) indentation makes seeing the body difficult. For example:
//DON’T USE THIS INDENTATION
if ((condition1 && condition2)
 || (condition3 && condition4)
 ||!(condition5 && condition6)) { //BAD WRAPS
 doSomethingAboutIt(); //MAKE THIS LINE EASY TO MISS
}
//USE THIS INDENTATION INSTEAD
if ((condition1 && condition2)
 || (condition3 && condition4)
 ||!(condition5 && condition6)) {
 doSomethingAboutIt();
}
//OR USE THIS
if ((condition1 && condition2) || (condition3 && condition4)
 ||!(condition5 && condition6)) {
 doSomethingAboutIt();
}
Here are three acceptable ways to format ternary expressions:
alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression) ? beta : gamma;
alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression) ? beta
 : gamma;
alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression)
 ? beta
 : gamma;




 7.3 return Statements
A return statement with a value should not use parentheses unless they make the return value
more obvious in some way. Example:
return;
return myDisk.size();
return (size ? size : defaultSize);
 



7.4 if, if-else, if-else-if-else Statements
The if-else class of statements should have the following form:
if (condition) {
statements;
}
if (condition) {
statements;
} else {
statements;
}
if (condition) {
statements;
} else if (condition) {
statements;
} else if (condition) {
statements;
}

Note: if statements always use braces {}. Avoid the following error-prone form:
if (condition) //AVOID! THIS OMITS THE BRACES {}!
statement;
